###Assignment 4: Interactive Visualization with D3

Using JavaScript and D3 (and no other graphing libraries), create an interactive version of the static D3 visualization you created for assignment 3. You will need to give it at least two modes of interaction using D3’s facilities for behaviors or transitions. Create one interaction that uses a button and one that doesn’t. Post your finished piece on the I School web site or elsewhere on the web (e.g., GitHub, JSFiddle), and turn in a screen capture with the URL. Make sure the live version is accessible to your instructor. No additional text or report is necessary for this assignment. 
 
Assignment due date: 12 noon PST, day of week 8 live session

In assignment 3, I used actual systolic blood pressure readings (mine) between March 20th and April 20th, 2014.  I took these readings at various points throughout the day over the course of this period.  For the interactivity required in this exercise, I employed both a mouseover and clickable text.  The mouseover tracks the x-axis position of the mouse and displays the systolic reading on the given date.  The clickable text shows the hypertension warning-zone ranges (for a typical adult male).
